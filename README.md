# 📊 Launchpad Bug Tracker (RRD-based)

This project tracks the number of **"New" bugs** for a Launchpad project (e.g., `nova`) and stores the count daily in a **Round-Robin Database (RRD)**. It then:

- Generates a **PNG graph** of the last 30 days
- Creates a simple **HTML dashboard** to view the graph
